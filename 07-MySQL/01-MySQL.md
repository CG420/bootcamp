# MySQL

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is a free and open source [relational database management system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) (RDBMS) currently under the control of Oracle. An RDBMS will store data a container called a table. This data is organized by rows and columns similar to a spreadsheet (aka tabular data). Relationships are joined by creating foreign key relationships between rows of data across multiple tables. MySQL uses Structured Query Language (SQL) to retrieve data from tables.
