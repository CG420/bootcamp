# PM2

## Introduction

PM2 is one of many process managers for NodeJS. We use it primarily to allow the server to auto-recover from errors and managing the number of processes running per machine.


To start up on boot.

```sh
vim /etc/rc.local
```
Add the line

```sh
cd /var/www/mean.example.com/app && ./bin/www
```

/etc/rc.local should now look like the following. You MUST start MongoDB prior to starting the website.

```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

#start mongo
service mongod start

#start mean.example.com
cd /var/www/mean.example.com/app && ./bin/www

exit 0
```
