## Structure
This course is designed to provide the student a hands on approach to learning web and hybrid mobile development. The goal is to provide someone who is new to development just enough to get themselves started building building real world applications. Expect lectures to makeup roughly 25%-50% of the course time with 50-75% of the time independently completing labs. Many subjects will receive little to no coverage the first time they are presented many of these subjects will be expanded upon in latter lessons and some will be covered under additional reading.

## Lecture
Lecture will cover the material presented in this repository. The root level of this repo is broken down into numbered sections i.e. *01-DevEnvironment* with each section consisting of multiple lessons or topics. The lectures are designed to be working lectures in which a topic will be explained and the students will work out examples during lecture time.

### Exercises
Think of these as a guided lab in which the instructor walks the student solving common development problems relating to the topic at hand.

## Labs
The best way to learn is by solving real problems. Labs are designed to build upon the current topic and previous lessons. Students may split up into pairs or solve the problem independently. If a pairs approach is chosen each student is still expected to submit their own source code.

## Additional Resources
Each topic will provide an additional reading section. These sections are comprised of links to free ebooks and articles. These will not be covered in class, it is expected that the student will review these links outside of lecture. Like additional reading these are links to third party tutorials. These may be completed during normal lab time if time permits or independently. Either way the student is expected to review and complete these tutorials.
