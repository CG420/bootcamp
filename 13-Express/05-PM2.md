# PM2

## Introduction

PM2 is one of many process managers for NodeJS. We use it primarily to allow the server to auto-recover from errors and managing the number of processes running per machine.

We will start by forcing MongoDB to start up on boot. *rc.local* executes as the system boots.

```sh
vim /etc/rc.local
```

Add the line ```service mongod start``` right before ```exit 0```. */etc/rc.local* should now read as follows, if it does reboot your system (DO NOT delete anything that was there before, we are only adding to the file).

```sh
#!/bin/sh -e
#
# rc.local
#
# This script is executed at the end of each multiuser runlevel.
# Make sure that the script will "exit 0" on success or any other
# value on error.
#
# In order to enable or disable this script just change the execution
# bits.
#
# By default this script does nothing.

# start MongoDB on boot
service mongod start

exit 0
```

When the system boots up type the command ```mongo``` into a terminal window, if MongoDB starts up you ready for the next step.


```sh
sudo npm -g install pm2
```

In Atom navigate to *mean.example.com* and add the file *process.yml* and add the following.
```yml
```

*.bashrc* executes when a given user account is loaded.

```sh
cd ~
vim .bashrc
```

Add the following line.
```sh
cd /var/www/mean.example.com && pm2 start process.yml && cd ~
```

Then restart your bash script.
```sh
. .bashrc
```

Navigate to *loc.mean.example.com*
