According to the jQuery website "jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript."<sup>[1]</sup>.

*Why we actually use it*

* Cross browser compatibility (write once run anywhere).
* Simply DOM manipulation.
* Nicely encapsulates AJAX functionality.
