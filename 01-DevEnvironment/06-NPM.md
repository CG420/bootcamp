# [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/)

Non-Parametric Mapping or (as it is most commonly but incorrectly known) Node Package Manager (NPM) is a package management system for managing Node.JS (JavaScript) packages. This is akin to Gems in relation Ruby platform, Composer as it relates to PHP or Python's PIP. Under the hood these may be very different in terms of how they operate but practically speaking they all accomplish the same goal; package management.

Node.JS is an insanely popular platform that allows you to build cross-platform applications using web technology. As a result many web development tools are written in Node. These tools can be installed using NPM. We will need to onstall Node.JS to get started with these tools. Follow the [Debian and Ubuntu Based Linux Distribution](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/#debian-and-ubuntu-based-linux-distributions) instructions from the Node.JS web site. Install the latest greatest version.

After install run the following commands
```sh
node -v
npm -v
```

These should return versions >= 8.10 and 5.7.1 respectively.
