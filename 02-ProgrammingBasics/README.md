# Introduction

In this section you will be introduced to the most basic concepts of programming; variables, data structures, and control statements.

Programming is little more that reading data and piecing together statements that take action on that data. This is typically done by making a [decision tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree). In programming these decision trees are constructed using [control-strucutres](https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Control_structures) which tend to flow based upon the current value of a memory addresses most commonly known as a variable.
