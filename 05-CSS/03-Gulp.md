# Gulp

Gulp allows you to build workflows for optimizing your frontend assets. As with SASS you can create a wathcer to auto build on save. GUlp offers additional feature such combining and minifing files. Since Gulp is a JavaScript package and the config file is written in JavaScript you can add any functionality you want.

```sh
sudo npm install -g gulp
cd /var/www/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/github.io
gulp init
```
