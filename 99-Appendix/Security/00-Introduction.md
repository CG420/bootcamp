# Security

This appendix contains information and resources pertinent to information security. While InfoSec is a field in and of itself; it is a cross-functional field. An understanding of security principles and best practices is crucial for long term success in any tecnical field. I highly reccomend for anyone serious about development to delve deeper into this topic.
