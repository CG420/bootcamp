# SEO
SEO is often packaged and sold as the silver bullet that will magically make you page rise to the top of result of any search engine. Many comapnies sell this snake oil, do not buy it. The only search engine that really matters is Google and as far as Google is concerned SEO is a [simple spec](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7451184?hl=en). There are some things you can do to help a search engine understand your content but avoid gaming the system. The system always learns the game. 

Here is my high-level SEO strategy:
* Original quality content is the number one thing you can do to boost your sites SEO.
* Do not try to play games, they will figure it out.
* Do not duplicate content without providing a canonical link.
* Provide a quality site; slow, insecure and poorly structured sites will get penalized.
* Use meta data but only if it is relevant to the content.
* Use Google Web Master tools to help analyze your site.
