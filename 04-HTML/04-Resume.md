# HTML Resume

Using MicroTrain's preferred [resume template](../img/ResumeTemplate.pdf) as a model create an HTML resume. This template hasbeen preloaded with skills you will learn in this course. For now do not worry about centered text, columns and left/right justiifcations. We will deal with all of that in CSS. For now We will  build a top down version of your resume. Startgin with your name in an ```h1``` tag. You might consider putting your contact information in a ```div``` using an HTML Entities, DEC or Hex values.

>**Reminder:** This will be on the public web, do not add any details you do not want to have posted to the web. You might consider showing only your city and links to LinkedIn and GitHub

```html
<h1>First Name Last Name</h1>
<div>
  <a href="..." target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a>
  &#x25CF;
  Some City, IL
</div>
```

You will follow that up with your desired job title in an ```h2``` tag then a paragraph ```p``` containing a breif summary, then a list ```ul``` of one or two highlights. Core Competencies is an ```h3``` followed by two bulleted list ```ul``` (just keep them stacked for now). Certifications / Technical Proficiencies willbe an ```h2``` followed by another bulleted list (CSS will make this no look like a list). Prfoessional Exepeience is back to an ```h2``` and each job starts with an ```h3```. From here try to figure out those tags for yourself.
